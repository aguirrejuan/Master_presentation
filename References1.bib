Abstract = {Background/aim: Knowledge regarding pain relief during labor remains
   insufficient. We aimed to determine and compare the effectiveness and
   safety of epidural analgesia, combined spinal-epidural analgesia, and
   parenteral meperidine on both mothers and fetuses.
   Materials and methods: This study was designed as an observational
   case-control study. We collected prospective data from patients whose
   labor pain management was conducted with meperidine in addition to
   retrospective cohort data of neuraxial methods; 138 patients were
   enrolled. Epidural analgesia group consisted of 68 patients, whereas
   combined spinal-epidural (CSE) analgesia group and meperidine group
   consisted of 50 and 20 patients, respectively. We compared the delivery
   patterns, labor durations, pain levels, side effects, maternal
   satisfaction levels, and neonatal outcomes of the various pain
   management methods.
   Results: Patient demographics, duration of first, second, and third
   labor stages, and instrumental delivery rates were comparable among
   groups (P > 0.05). Cesarean section tended to be less frequent in the
   CSE group. In the meperidine group, visual analog scale (VAS) values and
   sedation were significantly higher (P < 0.001) and maternal satisfaction
   lower (P < 0.001). Hypotension tended to be more frequent in the
   meperidine group. APGAR scores at the 1st and 5th min were similar among
   the groups and between meperidine subgroups defined by three different
   administration times (<1 h, 1-4 h, >4 h; P > 0.05).
   Conclusion: Neuraxial methods had no effect on instrumental delivery
   rates. CSE represented a near significant risk reduction in cesarean
   section. Our results demonstrated that regional analgesia methods were
   reasonably safe for both mother and fetus, and regional analgesia
   methods resulted in greater maternal satisfaction and pain control
   compared to meperidine.},

All successful blocks demonstrated a significant (P &lt; 0.0001) increase in median (range) of distal skin temperature of the thumb of 6.6°C (0.7 to 17.2) by 30 min, which was already significant (P &lt; 0.0001) by 5 min. By contrast, skin temperature decreased significantly (P &lt; 0.0001) in the hand after failed blocks and in the contra-lateral non-blocked hand by -1.5°C (-6.2 to 4.2).&lt;h4&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;Successful IBPB resulted in four thermographic patterns. Skin temperature always increased on the thumb within 30 min and this increase achieved statistical significance at 5 min after the block.},

abstract = {Summary There are multiple methods of assessing the height of block before caesarean section under regional anaesthesia, and surveys of practice suggest considerable variation in practice. So far, little emphasis has been placed on the guidance to be gained from published research literature or textbooks. We therefore set out to investigate the methods of block assessment documented in published articles and textbooks over the past 30 years. We performed two searches of PubMed for randomised clinical trials with caesarean section and either spinal anaesthesia or epidural anaesthesia as major Medical Subject Headings. A total of 284 papers, from 1984 to 2013, were analysed for methods of assessment of sensory and motor block, and the height of block deemed adequate for surgery. We also examined 45 editions of seven anaesthetic textbooks spanning 1950–2014 for recommended methods of assessment and height of block required for caesarean section. Analysis of published papers demonstrated a wide variation in techniques, though there has been a trend towards the increased use of touch, and an increased use of a block height of T5 over the study period. Only 115/284 (40.5\%) papers described the method of assessing motor block, with most of those that did (102/115; 88.7\%) describing it as the ‘Bromage scale’, although only five of these (4.9\%) matched the original description by Bromage. The required height of block recommended by textbooks has risen over the last 30 years to T4, although only four textbooks made any recommendation about the preferred sensory modality. The variation in methods suggested by surveys of practice is reflected in variation in published trials, and there is little consensus or guidance in anaesthetic textbooks.},

abstract = {Development and validation of pain biomarkers has become a major issue in pain research. Recent advances in multimodal data acquisition have allowed researchers to gather multivariate and multilevel whole-body measurements in patients with pain conditions, and data analysis techniques such as machine learning have led to novel findings in neural biomarkers for pain. Most studies have focused on the development of a biomarker to predict the severity of pain with high precision and high specificity, however, a similar approach to discriminate different modalities of pain is lacking. Identification of more accurate and specific pain biomarkers will require an in-depth understanding of the modality specificity of pain. In this review, we summarize early and recent findings on the modality specificity of pain in the brain, with a focus on distinct neural activity patterns between chronic clinical and acute experimental pain, direct, social, and vicarious pain, and somatic and visceral pain. We also suggest future directions to improve our current strategy of pain management using our knowledge of modality-specific aspects of pain.}
